# Currency_conversion_Bill_Splitting
A python program that lets you easily calculate your share of the bill and convert it to your banks currency. So if you for example went on vacation in a country with a different currency and your friend payed for the bill you will be able to calculate your share of the bill as well as convert the share into your banks currency.
